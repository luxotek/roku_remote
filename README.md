# roku_remote
ugly but functional roku remote in python


it needs the roku libraries so do a

pip install roku

and i made it work with windows with pyinstaller so do a

pip install pyinstaller

and then a

pyinstaller --onefile .\whatever-you-named-this.py

hopefully i'll get around to making it not pop an extra cmd window and not be so ugly but since i've just started with python a few weeks ago.. who knows
